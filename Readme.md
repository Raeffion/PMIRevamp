# [PMIRevamp](https://mabimods.net/index.php?topic=17936.0)
Mabinogi Interfaces based from [Venom Log's Poison Metro Interface.](https://mabimods.net/index.php?topic=16915.0)

## Features:
Two Color Themes with 4 Assorted Accents
Digitized Damage and Heal Numbers
Login Interface Changes

## Installation:
1. Ensure Mabinogi is closed and unblock the files downloaded in the file properties if necessary.
2. Place "PMIRevamp_RXXX[Color].pack" in "C:\[Mabinogi Directory]\package" and enjoy.

## Personalization:
1. Install Logue's MabiPacker if you don't already have it
2. Open "PMIRevamp[Color]_RXXX.pack" with MabiPacker.
3. Extract the file to your preferred directory.
4. Change individual files found within the data folder you extracted.
5. Open MabiPacker and pack the data folder.
6. Move the pack file you created into "C:\[Mabinogi Directory]\package"
Note: This theme replaces Mabinogi's Electric Gray interface (or "black.dds") by default. To make the interface load with a different Mabinogi interface, simply rename the file in accordance to its individual dds file. (i.e. "apricots.dds" "skyblue.dds" etc.)

A friendly reminder about mods: The use of mods are by no means risk-free. Even if you think it's a cool interface, only mention it to trustworthy people in private at your own risk; preferably, not in-game. It's no fault of my own if Nexon suspends your account.
